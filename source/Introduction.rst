Introduction
============

| This API lets brokers build a bridge to connect their backend systems to the TradingView interface. 
  The brokers then can be supported on the `TradingView Web Platform <https://www.tradingview.com/chart/>`_ 
  and/or license the `Trading Platform <https://www.tradingview.com/HTML5-stock-forex-bitcoin-charting-library/>`_. 
  The same bridge is used to enable both services, but each is licensed separately â€” so whether you go with one or 
  both is up to you.

| The integration is very simple. The broker builds a `REST Web API <https://www.tradingview.com/rest-api-spec/>`_ 
  on its own servers based on our specification so that it can be connected to TradingView. TradingView provides 
  a sandbox and required technical assistance to get your TradingView Web Platform integration started.
